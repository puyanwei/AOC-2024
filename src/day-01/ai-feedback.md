I'll analyze your solution in `historian-hysteria-2.ts`:

**Strengths:**

1. Good separation of concerns with distinct functions for counting matches and calculating scores
2. Clear type definitions with `Count` interface
3. Reuses functionality from Part 1 through imports
4. Descriptive variable and function names that make the code's purpose clear

**Areas for Improvement:**

1. **Performance:** Your `countMatches` function has O(n²) complexity due to nested loops:

```typescript
locations.forEach((location) => {
  locations.forEach((innerLocation) => {
    if (location.first === innerLocation.second) {
      matchCounts[location.first]++
    }
  })
})
```

Could be optimized to O(n) using a Map/object to count occurrences in a single pass, like:

```typescript
function countMatches(locations: Location[]): Count[] {
  const rightSideCount = locations.reduce((acc, loc) => {
    acc[loc.second] = (acc[loc.second] || 0) + 1
    return acc
  }, {} as Record<string, number>)

  return locations.map((loc) => ({
    value: loc.first,
    count: rightSideCount[loc.first] || 0,
  }))
}
```

2. **Type Safety:** Using string-based object indexing with `matchCounts[location.first]` could be made more type-safe using a Map:

```typescript
const matchCounts = new Map<string, number>()
```

3. **Immutability:** The solution uses mutable state with object modifications. Could be more functional by using immutable operations:

```typescript
function getSimilarityScore(counts: Count[]): number {
  return counts
    .map(({ value, count }) => parseInt(value) * count)
    .reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0)
}
```

4. **Configuration:** The data source is hardcoded. Could be made more flexible by passing it as a parameter:

```typescript
export function solve(filename: string): number {
  const data = importFromTextFileAndSplitByNewLine(`day-01/${filename}`)
  const locationIds = transformArraysAndReorderFromSmallToLarge(data)
  const matches = countMatches(locationIds)
  return getSimilarityScore(matches)
}
```

5. **Testing:** The commented-out example data suggests testing was done manually. Could benefit from proper unit tests:

```typescript
describe("historian-hysteria-2", () => {
  it("should calculate correct similarity score for example data", () => {
    const result = solve("example.txt")
    expect(result).toBe(31)
  })
})
```

Both solutions achieve the same result, but the functional approach in the refactored version offers:

- Better performance (O(n) vs O(n²))
- More immutable data handling
- Clearer data flow
- More type safety with Maps

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these points or provide more specific examples for improvement?
